Hi everyone,

This is my graduation project, and I've chosen to work on a website. Although I had many options, I felt this was the best fit. Currently, the site is about 33-44% complete. As I continue working on it, you'll be able to see the changes as they happen. I still have time to make observations and improvements before it's fully finished.

You can use it as a template or starting point for your own projects. If you have some ideas or solutions, feel free to reach out to me!

See you around, and I hope this is helpful!
